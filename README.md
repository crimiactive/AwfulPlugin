# AwfulPlugin
A PocketMine-MP plugin showing off bad coding practices (but it works!)

## What does it do?
Adds a `/setblock` command to your server. NEVER think of using this plugin in a production server. It's only meant to be a guide for future PocketMine developers. Read the comments in the code.
